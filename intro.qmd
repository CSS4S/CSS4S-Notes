# Intro: computational social science models as decision support tools

Resources are limited for developing educational or training programs aimed at 
improving *sustainable outcomes*, or any outcome. Here a *sustainable behavior*
is a behavior that promotes climate change adaptation, equitable development,
personal and public health, ecosystem protection, or otherwise advances one of
the [seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). 
Striving to meet these sustainable development goals helps to
meet the needs of people living today without sacrificing the future
avaiability of environmental, ecological, economic, and social capital needed to
support people of tomorrow.

For instance, in a public
health intervention study, @Airoldi2024 compared which of two methods was better
for selecting the *seed group* of people who would be first to be taught about
how to maintain good health, such as handwashing to prevent sickness 
or knowing warning signs of pregnancy complications. They found that seed groups
composed of randomly selected friends of a randomly selected people were
correlated with broader diffusion of these behaviors among rural Honduran
villagers, compared to plain random selection. This is an important finding
that could truy help ut could other methods have
worked better? How much do environmental and social context matter?
Perhaps one method might work well in one case is worse in another.

It would be difficult to follow this approach to infer which
of several methods is superior for new situations due to cost and logistics.
Computational modeling of social behavior offers an alternative. In the 
approach described here, we design
strategically simplified versions of the social systems of interest, then 
implement them as math or computer code. 
With one more step, either manipulate equations or *iterat* the model (i.e.,
*run* the model), we can observe a simulation of how behaviors *diffuse*
from person to person through instruction or observation. These models lend
themselves to application to different contexts since they can
support different assumptions about social network structure, learning strategies, 
environmental conditions, and other relevant factors.

There are a number of *motivating problems and empirical motivations* for
developing computational social science models for sustainability (see the [next
chapter](motivation.qmd). While this
course exists to assist in practical decision making to support sustainability,
the models we design and knowledge we gain in the process contribute to broader
efforts of augmenting our scientific understanding of social behavior
[@SmaldinoBook2023]. This work "stands on the shoulders of giants" of
social scientists, and even philosophers of science, who have struggled with
these problems, and the general problem of studying our own human behavior and
the social water that we swim in daily. Just like fish don't "know" that they
live in water, we humans are met with difficulties when we try to study
scientifically social behavior, for which we have deeply hard-wired and
culturally-learned folk understandings. It will take a special effort to break
loose of these folk understandings to create mechanistic models to use in our
analyses (discussed more in [Chapter 3](philosophy-of-css4s.qmd)).
